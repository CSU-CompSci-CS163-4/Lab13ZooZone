# Lab13 ZooZone
# Step 1 -- Writing the Methods
For this lab, you will be expected to complete the following methods:

Moving.java:
  - movingBoxes(String filename)
  - headCount()

For instructions on completing these methods, see the [Javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab13ZooZone/).

# Step 2 -- Testing
Make sure to test your work. Some of the methods are tested for you in main, but be sure to add your own tests!

# Step 3 -- Turning It In
Once you're done writing and testing the methods, zip "Moving.java" and submit that to canvas. You do not need to include any of the other Java file for the assignment.
